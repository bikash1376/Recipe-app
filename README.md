### Concept I learnt from this project 

* **Component-based architecture**: Creating and composing reusable React components to build your UI.
* **State management**: Using React hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage component state and side effects.
* **API integration**: Fetching data from an external API (Edamam) and integrating it into your React application.
* **Routing**: Implementing navigation between different views using React Router.
* **Local storage**: Persisting data (favorites) in the browser's local storage and syncing it with your app's state.
* **Responsive design**: Implementing a grid layout to display recipes in a visually appealing and responsive manner.
